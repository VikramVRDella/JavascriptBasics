1. AI-Powered Risk Forecasting
Instead of just recording what happened, use AI to predict what might happen.

Anomaly Detection: Use an Appwrite Function to send transaction data to an AI model (like OpenAI or a custom Python script). It can flag "unusual" spending or inventory patterns that might indicate fraud or supply chain leaks.

Automated Risk Scoring: Create a "Risk Score" attribute for every project or vendor. The system can automatically recalculate this score based on late deliveries, fluctuating prices, or compliance expirations.
